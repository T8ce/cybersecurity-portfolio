What I learned:
I worked  CompTIA simulations focused on network topologies and creating a SOHO networks The purpoe was test my knowledge on imlementing the coorect topologies with the correct network.

Challenges faced:
I found the CompTIA simulation platform less intuitive than I expected. Having previously worked on hands-on at home labs the virtual domaain proved to be a bit strucurally different from real life.

How I solved them:
I asked my classmates for assistance navigating the platform to make it easier to use.

Next steps:
I will revisit an earlier lab to become more familiar with the platformâ€™s GUI.
