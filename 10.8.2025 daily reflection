What I learned:
I worked on simulations focused on network topologies and creating a SOHO network.

Challenges faced:
I found the CompTIA simulation platform less intuitive than I expected.

How I solved them:
I asked my classmates for assistance navigating the platform to make it easier to use.

Next steps:
I will revisit an earlier lab to become more familiar with the platformâ€™s GUI.
