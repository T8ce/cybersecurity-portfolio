I have been an IT Project Manager for a tech company that provides SaaS and infrastructure deployment projects to government agencies. I currently work as a Physical Security Professional at a data center. 

**Career Plans:**
My goal is to obtain a career in cybersecurity as an analyst or another entry-to-mid-level position within the tech or healthcare industries. Later in my career, I plan to move toward governance, risk, and compliance.

Iâ€™m proud of completing a gap assessment capstone project. I was able to assess security controls, identify compliance gaps, and documenting recommendations using the NIST 2.0  & NIST 800-53 frameworks.
