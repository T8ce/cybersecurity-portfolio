**What I Learned:**  
We continued the lessons on cables and connectors, as well as structured cable installation. We also focused on hubs and bridges.

**Challenges Faced:**  
The lesson itself wasn’t particularly challenging, but the lab involving the selection and installation of a network adapter was a bit tricky.

**How I Solved Them:**  
I revisited the course material to better understand that media connectors vary by type and that I shouldn’t assume the correct selection is always based on the previous lesson. I realized I need to synthesize concepts from multiple lessons rather than rely solely on the most recent one when solving lab problems.

**Next Steps:**  
Continue completing the assigned simulations and readings going forward.
