**What I Learned:**  
We discussed hubs, bridges, and switches, primarily focusing on the types of cabling needed to avoid collisions â€” cross cabling versus straight-through. I also continued working on my labs.

**Challenges Faced:**  
None to speak of today. I completed my labs successfully.

**How I Solved Them:**  
None to speak of today. I completed my labs successfully.

**Next Steps:**  
Continue completing the assigned simulations and readings going forward.
