**What I Learned:**
I learned about structured cabling system, T568A & T568B temination standards, patch paneling, structured cabling installations, and termination tools and techniques. 

**Challenges Faced:**
What I found challenging was the simulation that required the use of a transceiver to convert the connector to a digital signal which will communicate with the switch on another floor of te building. 

**How I Solved Them:**
I did research to find out the correct connector I needed to use in order for the switches to communicate with each other.

**Next Steps:**
Continue with the assigned simulations going forward.
