### **What I Learned**  
Today I completed several labs focused on **network cable troubleshooting** and **physical connectivity diagnostics**. These exercises strengthened my understanding of how to identify, isolate, and resolve issues involving switches, patch panels, and workstation network interfaces.

---

### **Challenges Faced**  
One of the main challenges was maintaining a clear overview of which **devices and hardware components** were experiencing specific connectivity issues. Managing multiple failure pointsâ€”such as bad cables, inactive ports, and disconnected NICsâ€”required careful observation and structured tracking.

### **How I Solved Them**  
To stay organized, I created a **troubleshooting log in Notepad** to record each device, its symptoms, and the corrective steps taken. This method helped me visualize the network layout, trace fault domains efficiently, and prevent redundant troubleshooting steps.

---

### **Next Steps**  
Moving forward, I plan to continue the upcoming **CompTIA Network+ simulations** and explore **network management tools** (e.g., SolarWinds, PRTG, and Wireshark). My goal is to gain hands-on familiarity with how professionals monitor, track, and resolve network performance issues in real time.
