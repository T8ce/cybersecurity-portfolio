**What I Learned:**
We learned about supporting standards, physical installations, various methods of network data transmission, Ethernet standards, copper and fiber-optic cabling, connectors, and multiplexing.

**Challenges Faced:**
What I found not so much a challenge, but rather something unexpected, is that Ethernet cables (Cat7 and higher) now use the 8-point form factor GG45 connector. While I understand that technology is constantly evolving, I wasn’t expecting the connector type to change.

**How I Solved Them:**
As mentioned above, I didn’t encounter any major challenges today; however, I did a quick Google search to visually compare and contrast the two connector types.

**Next Steps:**
To round out my day, I will continue completing the assigned simulations and readings.
