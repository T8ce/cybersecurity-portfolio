What I Learned:
We volunteered at the nonprofit organization NPursuit, commissioning donated laptops to be redistributed to individuals. I was tasked with installing the operating system from a USB drive onto the primary (0) partition.

Challenges Faced:
A couple of challenges I faced included the first laptop not booting up to the BIOS screen because it had not been properly wiped (data not erased). I also realized I had selected the wrong category of devices, which was not a technical issue but rather a miscategorization error.
The second laptop booted to the correct screen, and the upload process initially ran smoothly; however, the device had to restart several times. During the final restart, the batch file failed to complete the upload, and after multiple attempts to restart and reinstall, the process would not finalize.

How I Solved Them:
I escalated the issue to the technician overseeing our group for further troubleshooting and guidance.

Next Steps:
Afterward, I continued working on my home lab. I terminated two (2) Cat 6 cables and one (1) Cat 5 cable. I set up the area with two (2) PCs, one (1) laptop, a Cisco switch, and a Wi-Fi extender/access point. All of these devices were connected to a surge protector for safety.
